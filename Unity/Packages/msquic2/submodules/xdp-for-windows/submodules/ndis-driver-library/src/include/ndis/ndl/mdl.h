Module Name:

    mdl.h

Provenance:

    Version 1.1.0 from https://github.com/microsoft/ndis-driver-library

Abstract:

    Utility functions for operating on MDL chains

Data structures:

    An MDL is a data structure that represents a single virtually-contiguous
    region of memory. To represent multiple regions of memory, MDLs can be
    chained into a linked list:

        +------+         +------+         +------+         +------+
        | MDL1 | - - - > | MDL2 | - - - > | MDL3 | - - - > | MDL4 | - - > NULL
        +------+         +------+         +------+         +------+

    Although these buffers are not actually contiguous in virtual memory, it's
    useful to imagine them being contiguous in a conceptual space; the
    conceptual payload of an I/O is the concatenation of each of these
    discontiguous buffers:

                        +------+------+------+------+
                        | MDL1 | MDL2 | MDL3 | MDL4 |
                        +------+------+------+------+

    The network stack commonly handles subsets of an MDL chain, defined by a
    byte offset into the chain and a byte length:

        |----- Offset ----->|
        |                   |---- Length ---->|
        |                   |                 |

        +----------------+------+-------------------+------------+
        |      MDL1      | MDL2 |      MDL3         |    MDL4    |
        +----------------+------+-------------------+------------+

        |                   |                 |                  |
        |   (ignored data)  |  Actual payload |  (ignored data)  |

    While you can represent a subset of an MDL chain using the tuple of
    <MdlChain, Offset, Length>, it's a bit clumsy to carry around three
    variables everywhere. So this module declares a couple core data structures
    to save you some typing:

    MDL_POINTER
        An MDL pointer refers to any location within an MDL chain's buffers.

    MDL_SPAN
        An MDL span repsents any contiguous subset of the logical concatenation
        of the MDL chain's buffers. That is, an MDL span is a tuple of
        <MdlChain, Offset, Length>.

Inputs:

    While this module offers MDL_POINTER and MDL_SPAN to save you some typing,
    it generally does not force you to use these types. Most routines are
    offered in two or three variants that accept either an
    <MdlChain,Offset,Length> or a MDL_SPAN. The type of inputs accepted can be
    identified from the routine's name:

    MdlChain-
        Accepts a linked list of MDLs and operates on every byte of their
        associated buffers.

    MdlChain-AtOffset
        Accepts a linked list of MDLs and operates on a subset of their
        associated buffers that is identified by offset and length parameters.

    MdlSpan-
        Accepts an MDL_SPAN and operates on the subset of buffers identified by
        the span.

    MdlPointer-
        Accepts an MDL_POINTER and begins operating at that point.

Operations:

    This module provides several high-level operations on MDL chains:

    MdlChainEnsureMappedSystemAddress
        Map each MDL in the chain into system virtual address space.

    MdlChainGetInformation
    MdlChainGetMdlCount
    MdlChainGetByteCount
    MdlChainGetPageCount
        Queries some metadata about the buffers described by the MDL chain.
        MdlChainGetInformation collects all information in one batch, while the
        other routines are convenience wrappers that collect a single, specfic
        bit of information.

    MdlChainAdvanceBytes
        Calculates the position of the byte that is N bytes into the MDL chain.

    MdlPointerAdvanceBytes
        Updates an MDL pointer to point N bytes ahead of its current location.

    MdlPointerNormalize
        Updates an MDL pointer to normal form. See the topic "Normalization".

    MdlChainZeroBuffers
    MdlSpanZeroBuffers
    MdlChainZeroBuffersAtOffset
        Zeros the buffer(s) associated with the MDL chain.
        Conceptually: RtlZeroMemory(Mdl).

    MdlChainFillBuffers
    MdlSpanFillBuffers
    MdlChainFillBuffersAtOffset
        Fills the buffer(s) associated with the MDL chain with a specific byte.
        Conceptually: RtlFillMemory(Mdl, FillPattern).

    MdlCopyFlatBufferToMdlSpan
    MdlCopyFlatBufferToMdlChainAtOffset
        Copies data from a single buffer into some subset of an MDL chain.
        Conceptually: RtlCopyMemory(Mdl, Buffer).

    MdlCopyMdlSpanToFlatBuffer
    MdlCopyMdlChainAtOffsetToFlatBuffer
        Copies data from some subset of an MDL chain into a single buffer.
        Conceptually: RtlCopyMemory(Buffer, Mdl).

    MdlCopyMdlPointerToMdlPointer
    MdlCopyMdlChainToMdlChainAtOffset
        Copies data from some subset of an MDL chain to a subset of another MDL
        chain. Conceptually: RtlCopyMemory(Mdl1, Mdl2).

    MdlEqualBufferContents
    MdlEqualBufferContentsAtOffset
        Determines whether the data in subsets of 2 MDL chains is equal.
        Conceptually: RtlEqualMemory(Mdl1, Mdl2).

Variants:

    This module offers a number of variations on each routine. The variations
    use a consistent naming pattern to help you quickly identify the best
    variant for your needs. For example, MdlChainZeroBuffers is also available
    in the variant MdlChainZeroBuffersNonTemporal -- the variant is denoted
    with the suffix "NonTemporal".

    These are the suffixes used in this module:

    -NonTemporal
        The routine attempts to avoid dragging MDL buffers into the CPU cache,
        to avoid polluting the cache with data that won't be accessed soon
        again. Compare with RtlCopyMemoryNonTemporal.

    -Secure
        The routine suppresses compiler optimizations to ensure that writes to
        memory are definitely not optimized away for any reason. Compare with
        RtlSecureZeroMemory.

    -UpdateInputs-
        This routine accepts an MDL_POINTER to identify where to read from or
        write to, and modifies it in-place to point to the end of the region
        that was read from or written to. (This can be useful if you want to
        access an MDL chain in fixed-length batches. For example, you may want
        to copy the payload of an MDL chain in chunks no larger than 64kb.)

Iteration:

    The various high-level routines offered by this module are based on a few
    low-level iterator routines. You may use these directly if none of the
    high-level routines meet your needs.

    MdlChainIterateBuffers
        This routine invokes a callback for each non-zero-length buffer in an
        entire MDL chain.

    MdlSpanIterateBuffers
        This routine invokes a callback for each non-zero-length buffer in a
        subset of an MDL chain, defined by an MDL span.

    MdlPairwiseIterateBuffers
        This routine invokes a callback for successive pairs of equal-length
        buffers from a pair of MDL chains.

    The last one deserves a diagram. Suppose you have these two MDL chains:

                            +----------+----------+------+
                Chain1:     |   MDL1   |       MDL2      |
                            +----------+----------+------+

                            +--------------+------+------+
                Chain2:     |     MDL1     | MDL2 | MDL3 |
                            +--------------+------+------+

                            |          |   |      |      |
                Callbacks:  |     1    | 2 |   3  |   4  |

     In this example, one chain has 2 MDLs and another chain has 3 MDLs.
     However, MdlPairwiseIterateBuffers invokes the callback 4 times, because
     the MDLs of the two chains don't line up on the same boundaries.

     Another way to look at it: if you wanted to implement a routine to compare
     the contents of two MDL chains, you'd have to run memcmp on several little
     chunks, since the MDL chains' payloads aren't contiguous.
     MdlPairwiseIterateBuffers figures out the little chunks for you, so you
     only have to implement the per-chunk logic. Incidentally, you don't have
     to implement one for memcmp at all, since MdlEqualBufferContents is
     already implemented for you.

Normalization:

    A pointer is in normal form if the pointer points directly into the MDL
    that it's referring to. In practical terms, this means you don't have to
    dereference Mdl->Next to get to the next byte of data at the pointer.

    As a special case, a pointer is also in normal form if its MDL is NULL and
    its offset is zero. This represents a pointer that points at the end of
    some MDL chain, or at the empty MDL chain.

    Formally, a pointer is normal if and only if:
        (Pointer->Mdl == NULL && Pointer->Offset == 0)
            ||
        (Pointer->Offset < MmGetMdlByteCount(Pointer->Mdl))

    The routines in this module accept either normal or denormalized pointers
    as inputs. When any routine in this module makes a callback or updates a
    pointer, it always offers to you a normalized pointer. So you can generally
    assume that any pointer (or span) you get back is normalized.

    If you would like to normalize a pointer yourself, you can call
    MdlPointerNormalize.

Customization:

    You may optionally define any of the following macros to customize the
    behavior of these routines to suit your environment. If you do not define a
    macro, it will default to reasonable behavior for a production-grade
    network kernel driver.

    MDL_MAPPING_OPTIONS
        Control the 2nd parameter to MmGetSystemAddressForMdlSafe. For example,
        you may request a HighPagePriority, or readonly mappings.

    MDL_MAP_BUFFER
    MDL_MAP_CONST_BUFFER
        Select which routine performs MDL mapping. You may inject additional
        logic, for example, statistical counters.

    MDL_REPORT_FATAL_OVERFLOW
        Terminate the system when a programming error has been detected. This
        routine must not return back to the caller.

    MDL_PREFETCH_CACHELINE
        Prefetch data from RAM to improve performance.

Environment:

    Kernel mode

    This header does not depend on NDIS.H or any other network-specific stuff,
    so you can freely use it in your storage or HID driver. However, MDL
    chains are primarily of interest to network drivers, so you probably don't
    need this header in a storage driver.

Routine Description:

    Given an offset into an MDL chain, calculates which individual MDL is
    associated with the buffer at that offsets, along with the remaining offset
    into that specific MDL's buffer

    For example, consider the MDL chain below:

      MdlChain
              \
               |----------- AdvanceOffset ---------->|
               |                                     |

               +--------+------+----------------------------+--------+
               |  MDL1  | MDL2 |            MDL3            |  MDL4  |
               +--------+------+----------------------------+--------+

                               |                     |

                              /
                      FoundMdl

    In this example, by advancing `AdvanceOffset` bytes into the MDL chain
    starting at MDL1, we wind up pointing some distance into MDL3. MDL3 is
    returned as `FoundMdl` and that distance is returned as `FoundMdlOffset`.

    As a special case, if `AdvanceOffset` is exactly equal to the length of the
    entire MDL chain, then `FoundMdl` receives NULL and `FoundMdlOffset`
    receives 0.

    If `AdvanceOffset` is greater than the length of the entire MDL chain, this
    routine crashes the system with a fatal overflow error.

Arguments:

    MdlChain
        The MDL at which to start iteration

    AdvanceOffset
        The number of bytes to advance

    FoundMdl

        contains the byte at AdvanceOffset from the start of the MDL chain

Routine Description:

    Copies data from an MDL chain into a buffer

    If SourceOffset plus CopyLength is greater than the total length of the MDL
    chain, this routine crashes the system with a fatal overflow error.

    If permitted by the processor, this routine uses non-temporal instructions
    to avoid placing the MDL buffers into the processor's data cache.

Arguments:

    DestinationBuffer
        The buffer to write into

    SourceMdlChain
        The MDL chain to read from

    SourceOffset
        The offset into the MDL chain at which to begin reading

    CopyLength
        The number of bytes to copy

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS
        Every buffer was processed successfully

    STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES
        The system was unable to map an MDL into system address space
